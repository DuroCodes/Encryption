# Simple Python Encryption Tool
This encryption tool turns each character in a string into a byte dictionary and encrypts it. There is also a decryption built inside of the software.
### To Use:
1. Put your text inside of the "text.txt" file located in the root directory.
2. Run the program, and choose option '1' to encrypt your text.
3. If you wish to decrypt a text, you can choose option '2' and put the text inside of "text.txt".
4. You can edit the code as you wish; this was just to test out some ideas!
